# Student-Record-System

## Description
This project showcases my implementation of a student record management system using hash tables and chaining for collision resolution. I developed this system to efficiently manage and query student records, which highlights my understanding of hash maps and data structures.

## Prerequisites
C Compiler: Ensure you have a C compiler like GCC or Clang installed.
Basic C Development Tools: Make sure you have standard development tools such as make if you're using a Makefile.

## Running
Just copy the code from inside student_report_system.c and paste it in your C file. 

## Usage
After compiling and running the program, you can query student records by providing a student's name as a command-line argument. The program will check if the student is in the system and display their details if found.
